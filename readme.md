# Gallows

Alura's final project of its JavaScript course

## Rules

- Only ECMAScript 5
- Follow step by step

## 1st Step
- Make the sprite change in 0.5s iterations from start to end

- Add `reset()` function to go back to first frame;
- Add `isFinished()`, which returns `boolean`;

## 2nd Step
- Create a class to manipulate the game logic named `jogo.js`

- Add `setPalavraSecreta(palavra)` to set a word to be guessed
- Add `getLacunas()` to get an array filled with an empty string for each letter of the chosen word
- Add `getEtapa()`, that returns a number that represents the game state
